My detailed report on the purpose of my app.
My app the app in front of you is to help you to study by using flashcard like in the app  ,there can be more than one option study work  for my app but  I was tasked to use history and in the app you answer 5 questions and receive a score based on how well you did in the questions and there will be a review and the review is there to help you improve on what you did not do correct and the purpose of the app is to help people who struggels to study the purpose is to improve on how you study.the design is put in place to make it look good and to make it more understanding for the user,you have to keep your design consideration in mind when you are creating an app to make it understandable and not to complicated to create.the utilization of git hub and githubactions makes it easier for the creater to publish their work and for other users and creaters and teatchers to access.
